    "description": "This dataset contains the distinct architectonic Area hOc1 (V1, 17, CalcS) in the individual, single subject template of the MNI Colin 27 as well as the MNI ICBM 152 2009c nonlinear asymmetric reference space. As part of the Julich-Brain cytoarchitectonic atlas, the area was identified using cytoarchitectonic analysis on cell-body-stained histological sections of 10 human postmortem brains obtained from the body donor program of the University of Düsseldorf. The results of the cytoarchitectonic analysis were then mapped to both reference spaces, where each voxel was assigned the probability to belong to Area hOc1 (V1, 17, CalcS). The probability map of Area hOc1 (V1, 17, CalcS) are provided in the NifTi format for each brain reference space and hemisphere. The Julich-Brain atlas relies on a modular, flexible and adaptive framework containing workflows to create the probabilistic brain maps for these structures.

    "description": "This dataset contains automatically created cytoarchitectonic maps of Area hOc1 (V1, 17, CalcS) in the BigBrain dataset [Amunts et al. 2013]. The mappings were created using Deep Convolutional Neural networks based on the idea presented in Spitzer et al. 2017 and Spitzer et al. 2018, which were trained on delineations on every 120th section created using the semi-automatic method presented in Schleicher et al. 1999. Mappings are available on every section. Their quality was observed by a trained neuroscientist to exclude sections with low quality results from further processing. Automatic mappings were then transformed to the 3D reconstructed BigBrain space using transformations used in Amunts et al. 2013, which were provided by Claude Lepage (McGill). Individual sections were used to assemble a 3D volume of the area, low quality results were replaced by interpolations between nearest neighboring sections. The volume was then smoothed using an 11³ median filter and largest connected components were identified to remove false positive results of the classification algorithm.\nThe dataset consists of a single HDF5 file containing the volume in RAS dimension ordering and 20 micron isotropic resolution in the dataset “volume” and affine transformation matrix in the dataset “affine”. An additional dataset “interpolation_info” contains a vector with an integer value for each section which indicates if a section was interpolated due to low quality results (value 2) or not (value 1).\nDue to the large size of the volume, it’s recommended to view the data online using the provided viewer link.\n",

All tissue sections correspond to those of the BigBrain dataset ([Amunts et al., 2013](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/340/6139/1472)). To analyze the internal feature representations learned by the model, 5184 filter activations from the batch-normalized output of each Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) of the CNNs were calculated for section number 1021 of the histological stack. We described and analyzed these filter activations to better understand the internal feature representations of the trained networks.

Each probabilistic map is defined by histological analysis of ten individual postmortem brains. Thus they are capturing human intersubject variability and therefore describe how likely a particular structure is found at each voxel position of the reference spaces. Details for each particular probabilistic map can be found in associated journal publications. \nThe probability maps were combined into four-dimensional NIfTI files, one per reference space. This way, the entire Julich-Brain Atlas is offered in a bundled format and still retains the probability information of the individual probability maps. Each NIfTI file is accompanied by a text file, which provides the mapping of the index in the fourth dimension to the respective brain region. ",

From a large cohort of healthy individuals [Nooner et al. 2012](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2012.00152), we selected a subgroup of 466 participants with good quality preprocessed T1-weighted MR-scans, using CAT12 toolbox [http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat/](http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat/), and available scores in a broad range of psychometric measures covering multiple cognitive domains (such as attention, episodic memory), personality and emotion scores. The preprocessed individual GMV maps, their corresponding psychometric scores and the regions of the Julich-Brain Cytoarchitectonic Atlas are then entered into the pyJUSBB tool [https://github.com/shahrzadkh/pyJUSBB/](https://github.com/shahrzadkh/pyJUSBB/), where non-parametric partial correlations between variability in average GMV in each of the brain regions and each of the 48 behavioral scores are assessed and ranked to create the behavioral profile of each region. The stability of each association is demonstrated as 95% Bootstrap confidence interval (10000 times). ",

As part of the Julich-Brain cytoarchitectonic atlas, the area was identified using cytoarchitectonic analysis on cell-body-stained histological sections of 10 human postmortem brains obtained from the body donor program of the University of Düsseldorf. The results of the cytoarchitectonic analysis were then mapped to both reference spaces, where each voxel was assigned the probability to belong to Area hOc1 (V1, 17, CalcS). The probability map of Area hOc1 (V1, 17, CalcS) are provided in the NifTi format for each brain reference space and hemisphere.
