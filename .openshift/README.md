# Deployment documentation

This document outlines the deployment of `siibra-api` on EBRAINS infrastructure.

## Overview

`siibra-api` are continuously deployed on openshift container platform hosted by EBRAINS.

The continuous deployment of `siibra-api` involves the following steps:

- building docker image
- tag the image, and push to registry
- pull and run the newly built image

## Build

This section outlines the procedure of continuously building and archiving docker images of `siibra-api`.

### Images

Docker images are built with [`Dockerfile`](../Dockerfile) by github action withs [yml spec](../.github/workflows/docker-img.yml), and pushed to EBRAINS docker image registry at docker-registry.ebrains.eu

`docker-registry.ebrains.eu` is set as the registry

`siibra` is set as the namespace

`siibra-api` is set as the image name

The built image will be tagged with one of the three tags depending on the trigger condition.

| tag | trigger condition |
| --- | --- |
| next | push to `next` branch |
| latest | push to `master` branch |
| rc | release name include the string `rc` |
| stable | all other releases |

The built image will be tagged as:

`docker-registry.ebrains.eu/siibra/siibra-api:{latest|rc|stable}`

### Registry

The built docker image will then be pushed to `docker-registry.ebrains.eu` with the access token of a bot account with the rights to push image in `siibra` namespace.

The login credentials are stored in github action secrets:

- username: `{{ secrets.EBRAINS_DOCKER_REG_USER }}`
- access token: `{{ secrets.EBRAINS_DOCKER_REG_TOKEN }}`

> :warning: There are currently no mechanism to delete artefacts from `docker-registry.ebrains.eu`. One must periodically, manually delete untagged images to avoid filling of allotted diskspace.

---

// TODO setup retention policy to allow automatic deletion of artefacts

---

## Deployment

This section outlines how the built image are deployed.

> :info: Previous internal guides described a combination of s2i with docker build strategy. This has been demonstrated to be both slow (at build time) and unreliable (over the deployment lifetime).

### Variables

| name | value | 
| --- | --- |
| `PROJECT_NAME` | `siibra-api` |
| `OKD_ENDPOINT` (prod) | `https://okd.hbp.eu:443` |
| `OKD_ENDPOINT` (dev) | `https://okd-dev.hbp.eu:443` |
| `OKD_SECRET` (prod) | `{{ secrets.OKD_PROD_SECRET }}` (generated once[1], stored in github action secrets) |
| `OKD_SECRET` (dev) | `{{ secrets.OKD_DEV_SECRET }}` (generated once[1], stored in github action secrets) |


### Triggering deployment

Deployments resides in [docker-img.yml](../.github/workflows/docker-img.yml), `job['deploy-on-okd']`. The steps are summarised as below:

- determine if targeting prod or dev cluster.

  - If the trigger is update of `master` or `next` branch, target dev cluster

  - If the trigger is release, target prod cluster

- login to openshift container platform with the command

  ```bash
  oc login ${OKD_ENDPOINT} --token ${OKD_SECRET}
  ```

- checkout project `siibra-api` with the command

  ```bash
  oc project ${PROJECT_NAME}
  ```

- check if deployment with name `siibra-api-branch-deploy-${DEPLOY_FLAVOUR}` exists
  - if exists, rollout latest deployment with the command 
  
    ```bash
    oc rollout latest dc/siibra-api-branch-deploy-${DEPLOY_FLAVOUR}
    ```

  - if does not exist, create new deployment with name `siibra-api-branch-deploy-${DEPLOY_FLAVOUR}`, using deployment template[2] with corresponding parameters[3]

### [1] OKD service accounts

In order to deploy on OKD clusters in CI/CD pipeline, it is ideal to create a service account. Openshift container platform maintains [a comprehensive guide](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/dev_guide/service_accounts.html) on service account. This section provides a step by step guide on creating the service account.

> :info: Why not just use personal access token? 1/ it expires, 2/ it is invalidated when you logout, 3/ (to a less degree, since personal access token has a expiration), revoking personal access token has a greater impact on developer experience, and potentially breaks more things, if one reuses the same personally access token.

#### Prereq

- openshift cli installed (check via `which oc`)
- login command (easiest method to obtain login command: login via web portal > portrait username (*top right*) > Copy Login Command )

#### Configure a Service Account

- login via terminal (paste login command from prereq)
- select the desired project via `oc project ${PROJECT_NAME}`
- create a new SA via: `oc create sa ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}`
- get a new token via: `oc sa get-token ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}` (store this token securely, ideally in a password manager)
- grant the SA ability to create deployments via: `oc policy add-role-to-user edit -z ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}`


### [2] Deployment template

An [openshift template](./branch-deploy-template.yml) has been added to both production (https://okd.hbp.eu) and develop (https://okd-dev.hbp.eu) clusters.

This is done ahead of any deploys, is valid for all future deploys and rarely needs to be updated.

> :warning: The process of adding/editing template is fragile and error prone. One should be vigilant and update the template as little as possible.

The template is produced mainly by referencing Openshift container platform [template API](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/rest_api/template_openshift_io/template-template-openshift-io-v1.html).

A number of sensitive variables are stored on the openshift clusters, and added to the container at runtime. They include:

| variable name | from | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | `okd_secret.siibra-redis.database-password` | password to redis |
| `EBRAINS_IAM_CLIENT_ID` | `okd_configmap.hbp-oauth-config-map.HBP_CLIENTID` | Client ID for oauth with EBRAINS IAM service |
| `EBRAINS_IAM_CLIENT_SECRET` | `okd_configmap.hbp-oauth-config-map.HBP_CLIENTSECRET` | Client secret for oauth with EBRAINS IAM service |
| `EBRAINS_IAM_REFRESH_TOKEN` | `okd_configmap.hbp-oauth-config-map.REFRESH_TOKEN` | Refresh token used to generate valid access token for server to server communications. |
| `SIIBRA_CONFIG_*` | `okd_configmap.siibra-config-overwrite.*` | Overwriting siibra config environment variables |

### [3] Deployment parameters

Per [deployment template](./branch-deploy-template.yml), a number of parameters may be required when creating new deployments.

| name | required | desc | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | | Random strings to encrypt sessions. Not currently used. |
| `DEPLOY_FLAVOUR` | true | Acts similar to deploy ID. Distinguishes one deployment from another. Currently, possible values are `{latest\|rc\|stable}`. Also affects routes: `siibra-api-{DEPLOY_FLAVOUR}.apps{DEPLOY_SITE_POSTFIX}.hbp.eu` |
| `DEPLOY_SITE_POSTFIX` | | Dictates if postfix, if any, should be added to the route: `siibra-api-{DEPLOY_FLAVOUR}.apps{DEPLOY_SITE_POSTFIX}.hbp.eu`. Defaults to `''` (empty string). Possible value: `-dev`|
