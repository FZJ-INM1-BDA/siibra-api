# Technology Readiness Level (TRL)

This checklist is extracted from the [HBP Technology Readiness Level (TRL) guide](https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/collaborate/innovation/technology-readiness-level/)


## TRL1 Project initiation
- [ ] Basic technology processes and scientific knowledge underpinning software applications (architecture, formulation) are known.
- [ ] Technology principles and high-level objectives are defined.
- [ ] Supporting Information includes published research or other references that identify the principles.
- [ ] Ethical aspects for software production and operation are addressed and compliant with EU policies. 
- [ ] Use case definitions, including target users and activities.

## TRL2 Conceptualisation
- [ ] Practical applications are identified. However, applications may be still speculative, and there may be not yet a detailed analysis to support the assumptions. 
- [ ] Most of the work is analytical or paper studies with the emphasis on understanding the concept better.
- [ ] Experimental work is designed to corroborate scientific principles, including validation criteria for critical components and basic properties of algorithms.
- [ ] PoC(proof-of-concept) being planned, starting with preliminary simulations with synthetic data.

## TRL3 Proof of concept implementation
- [ ] Analytical studies and small-scale studies to validate the analytical predictions of separate components of the software have been performed (modelling and simulation may be used to complement experiments).
- [ ] Software components are validated, but there is no attempt yet to integrate the components into a complete system.

## TRL4 Prototype component
- [ ] Key software modules are integrated, functionally validated, and tested with a range of data sets, to establish interoperability and begin architecture development. 
- [ ] It is an alpha prototype integrated locally and containing key components to demonstrate basic functionality and critical test environments against expected system performance goals.
- [ ] Supporting information includes the experimental components and experimental test results differing from the expected system performance goals.
- [ ] Initial architecture documentation available.

## TRL5 Prototype integration
- [ ] End-to-end software elements integrated with key components, as well as implemented and interfaced with existing systems/simulations conforming to target environment. 
- [ ] Supporting information includes results from the laboratory scale testing, analysis of the differences between the laboratory and eventual operating system/environment, and analysis of what the experimental results mean for the eventual operating system/environment.
- [ ] All required data formats have been specified. 
- [ ] Increased fidelity of the system and environment to the actual application.
- [ ] The medium-fidelity prototype has been tested at laboratory scale system to demonstrate overall performance in a relevant environment.

## TRL6 Pilot-scale prototype to real-world integration
- [ ] Integrated systems or high-fidelity prototype implementations of the software are tested in a relevant environment under expected load, being demonstrated onfull-scale realistic problems.
- [ ] The operating environment for the testing closely represents the actual operating environment.
- [ ] Initial system documentation, user documentation and final architecture documentation are available. 

## TRL7 Operational integration
- [ ] Validation of a prototype software with all key functionality available in a relevant real-world environment.
- [ ] Well integrated with operational hardware/software systems demonstrating operational feasibility.
- [ ] Most software bugs removed.
- [ ] No expected data format or application programming interfaces changes.
- [ ] Supporting information includes results from the full-scale testing and analysis of the differences between the test environment.
- [ ] Final design is virtually complete.

## TRL8 Deployment
- [ ] Full software system has been proven to work in its final form and under expected conditions, i.e. the end-to-end system has been already created with all components.
- [ ] All functionality successfully demonstrated in simulated operational scenarios.
- [ ] End-to-end system tested and integrated in a real-world environment with a small number of real users.
- [ ] Software has been thoroughly tested (user-acceptance and performance) and debugged.
- [ ] Software has been fully integrated with all operational hardware and software systems.
- [ ] All user documentation, training documentation and maintenance documentation completed, including software/system requirements and architecture/design related descriptions.

## TRL9 Production
- [ ] System is in its final form and operated under the full range of operating conditions. 
- [ ] Tested in a real-world environment with a target number of real users.
- [ ] Sustaining software engineering support is in place (e.g. forum, issue tracking, help desk, bug reporting email, etc.)
- [ ] Final product operates over the full range of expected conditions.
