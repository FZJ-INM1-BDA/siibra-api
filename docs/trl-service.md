# Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for services

This checklist is extracted from the [HBP Technology Readiness Level (TRL) guide](https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/collaborate/innovation/technology-readiness-level/)


## RL1 Project initiation
- [ ] Basic principles of the service are known.
- [ ] High-level objectives defined.
- [ ] Supporting information includes published research or other references that identify the principles.
- [ ] Ethical aspects for service operation are addressed and compliant with EU policies.
- [ ] Use case definitions (includes target users and activities)

## RL2 Conceptualisation
- [ ] Practical applications of the service are identified. However, applications are speculative, and there may be no proof or detailed analysis to support the assumptions. 
- [ ] Most of the work is analytical with the emphasis on understanding the service better.
- [ ] Validation work is designed to corroborate principles.
- [ ] PoC (proof-of-concept) is being planned, starting with preliminary service simulations.

## RL3 Proof of concept implementation
- [ ] It includes analytical studies to validate the performance of separate elements of the service. 
- [ ] These elements are validated (modelling and simulation may be used to complement the validation) but there is no attempt to integrate them into a complete service system.

## RL4 Prototype component
- [ ] Key service elements are integrated, and functionally validated, to establish interoperability. 
- [ ] Supporting information includes validation of elements and those results that differ from the expected service performance goals.
- [ ] Initial version of the service to demonstrate basic functionality and testing critical environments ready.

## RL5 Prototype integration
- [ ] End-to-end service elements integrated, as well as implemented and interfaced with existing systems conforming to target environment.
- [ ] Supporting information includes results from the testing, analysis of the differences between the test and eventual operating system/environment and analysis of what the tested results mean for the eventual operating system/environment.

## RL6 Pilot-scale prototype to real-world integration
- [ ] Integrated service is tested in a relevant environment being demonstrated on full-scale realistic problems. 
- [ ] This is a step up from tests to operational real-world scale and the determination of scaling factors that will enable design of the service system.
- [ ] The operating environment for the testing should closely represent the actual operating environment.
- [ ] System monitoring points identified.
- [ ] Initial service documentation and initial user documentationare available. 

## RL7 Operational integration
- [ ] Validation of the service with all key functionality available in a relevant real-world environment. 
- [ ] Well integrated with other systems and services demonstrating operational feasibility.
- [ ] Supporting information includes results from the full-scale testing and analysis of the differences between the test environment.
- [ ] System monitoring points implemented.
- [ ] SLA monitored.
- [ ] No expected service changes.
- [ ] Final design is virtually complete.

## RL8 Deployment
- [ ] Full service has been proven to work in its final form and under expected conditions. 
- [ ] All functionality successfully demonstrated in simulated operational scenarios.
- [ ] Tested in a real-world environment with a small number of real users.
- [ ] SLA enforced.
- [ ] The service has been fully integrated with all operational systems.
- [ ] all user documentation, training documentation and following-up documentation is completed.

## RL9 Production
- [ ] Service is in its final form and running under the full range of operating conditions. 
- [ ] It has been thoroughly depurated and fully integrated with all operational systems.
- [ ] Tested in a real-world environment with a target number of real users.
- [ ] All documentation has been completed.
- [ ] Service engineering and following-up support is in place.
- [ ] Final service operates over the full range of expected conditions.
