> :warning: **`siibra-api` is still at an experimental stage.** The API of the library is not
stable, and the software is not yet fully tested. You are welcome to install and
test it, but be aware that you will likely encounter bugs.

## Overview

Siibra-API provides an easy REST access to the siibra-python features.

The main goal is to abstract the python functionalities in a way that they can be used via HTTP and make it more independent and accessible.

## Documentation

All of the public endpoints provided by siibra-api are documented by openapi, see [swagger](https://siibra-api-stable.apps.hbp.eu/v3_0/docs#/) [redoc](https://siibra-api-stable.apps.hbp.eu/v3_0/redoc).

Development documentations can be found on [readthedocs](https://siibra-api.readthedocs.io/) .

## Configuration

siibra-api can be configured by:

- environment variables, as indicated by the `./api/siibra_api_config.py` , or ...
- directly overwriting the `./api/siibra_api_config.py` file, by overwriting or docker volume mounting
